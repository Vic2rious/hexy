# Hexapod ðŸª°ðŸ¤–

Welcome to our Hexapod project repository! This repository contains all the code and documentation science fair project on Hexapod robotics. Our Hexapod, inspired by the motion of insectds, is an example of bio-inspired engineering. Here, you'll find detailed documentation of our Hexapod, along with the code needed to control its movements. In order to precisely calculate the joint movement of our Hexapod we use [Inverse Kinematics](https://motion.cs.illinois.edu/RoboticSystems/InverseKinematics.html)

This project as a whole has been heavily inspired by [MarkWTech](https://markwtech.com/robots/hexapod/)
